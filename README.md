# Text Classification with BERT on IMDb Dataset

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for text classification. Specifically, we'll be performing sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset, which contains movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The project involves loading a pre-trained BERT model, fine-tuning it on the IMDb dataset, evaluating the model, and visualizing the results.
